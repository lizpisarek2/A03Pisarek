// This file tests our application code - open the associated HTML file in a browser to see the test results. 

// It uses QUnit, a unit testing library for JavaScript. 

// Unit testing is a common, professional practice. 

// It helps us verify our code is correct in all cases.

// Modify the code in your appplication to get these tests to pass.

// The following is a helpful summary of all the QUnit asserts: 

//deepEqual(value, expected[, message]): A recursive, strict comparison that works on all the JavaScript types. The assertion passes if value and expected are identical in terms of properties, values, and they have the same prototype;
//equal(value, expected[, message]): Verify the value provided is equal the expected parameter using a non-strict comparison (==).
//notDeepEqual(value, expected[, message]): Same as deepEqual() but tests for inequality;
//notEqual(value, expected[, message]): Same as equal() but tests for inequality;
//propEqual(value, expected[, message]): A strict comparison of the properties and values of an object. The assertion passes if all the properties and the values are identical;
//strictEqual(value, expected[, message]): Verify the value provided is equal to the expected parameter using a strict comparison (===);
//notPropEqual(value, expected[, message]): Same as propEqual() but tests for inequality;
//notStrictEqual(value, expected[, message]): Same as strictEqual() but tests for inequality;
//ok(value[, message]: An assertion that passes if the first argument is truthy;
//throws(function [, expected ] [, message ]): Test if a callback throws an exception, and optionally compare the thrown error;

QUnit.test("Here's a test that should always pass", function (assert) {
    assert.ok(1 <= "3", "1<3 - the first agrument is 'truthy', so we pass!");
});

QUnit.test('Testing letsMultiply function with several sets of inputs', function (assert) {

     assert.equal(letsMultiply(6, 5), 30, 'Passing 6 and 5 correctly returns 30');
     assert.throws(function () {letsMultiply('String', 5); }, 'Passing in first as a String correctly raises an Error');
 });
